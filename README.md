This file is divided into two files: data processing and visualisation.

The data processing file contains the source code used to process the original data. Due to the large size of the original data, it could not be uploaded. Therefore the original data was uploaded to Github and the Github link was placed in the appendix of the paper.

The visualisation file contains all the code and the data used. The main page of the visualisation system can be opened by running main.html.
Guide.png in the visualisation file sorts out the hierarchy between the different html files.
